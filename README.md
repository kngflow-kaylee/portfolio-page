# 🌟 My Developer Portfolio — Page One

Welcome to the first page of my personal developer portfolio. This space highlights who I am, the work I create, and the skills I’m building as I grow into a stronger, more confident front‑end developer. It’s designed to be clean, modern, and easy to explore — just like the projects I love building.
